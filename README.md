# Zelos
> Greek god of emulation

The goal of this project is to define a standard interface for cosmological
power spectra emulation.

If you have any strong opinions on emulators, feel free to have a look at
the  [design document](design.md) and/or look through the issues.

Any comments and feedback welcome!
